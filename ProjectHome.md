# UtoPeak #

UtoPeak is a tool developed at Versailles University, France. It is able to compute a frequency sequence to grant the lowest energy consumption for an application execution. Associate to the ideal sequence of frequencies UtoPeak predicts, ahead of time, the potential impact of Dynamic Frequency Scaling (DVFS)
